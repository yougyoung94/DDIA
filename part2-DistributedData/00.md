Why distribute data across multiple machines?
1. Scalability
    - your data grow ➡️ `partitioning`
2. Fault tolerance / high availability
    - `replication` ➡️ redundancy
3. Latency
    - `replication` ➡️ serve data from servers closer to the user

Scaling to Higher Load
- `shared-memory architecture` ❌
    - single machine
    - fast cost growth + limited fault tolerance(∵ single geographic location)
- `shared-disk architercutre` ❌
    - several machines storing data on shared disks, connected via fast network
    - limited scalability(∵ contention and the overhead of locking)
- `shared-nothing architecture` ❗️ = horizontal scaling / scaling up
    - each `node` has its own CPUs, RAM, and disks, connected via conventional network
    - best price/performance ratio + ↑ availability & ↓ latency(∵ multiple geographic regions)

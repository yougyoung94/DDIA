# Partitioning
scalability ⭐️
- Spread the data and query load evenly across multiple machines

## 1. Partitioning and Replication
- Usually used in combination
- Strategies are mostly independent of each other
- Single-leader replication + partitioning

## 2. Partitioning of Key-Value Data
How to prevent `skewedness`? How to avoid `hot spot`?

### 1. Partitioning by Key Range
- How
    - keys are *sorted* in each partition 
    - assign a continuous range of keys to each partition

- Good
    - efficient range queries

- Bad
    - risk of hot spots
        - if the applications often accesses keys close together in the sorted order  
        - ex. Partitioned by date: all the writes of the day go to corresponding partition
- Rebalancing

### 2. Partitioning by Hash of Key
- How
    - use hash function for keys
    - assign a range of *hashes* to each partition
        - ranges may be decided evenly 
        - or pseudorandomly: `consistent hashing`

- Good
    - more evenly distributed keys and load

- Bad
    - inefficient range queries
        - MongoDB: any range query sent to all the partitions
        - Riak, Couchbase, Voldemort: range queries on primary key not supported
- Rebalancing

Compromise between them: compound key
- How
    - Use one part of the key to hash ➡️ partition
    - Use another part to sort within the partition

### 3. Skewed Workloads and Relieving Hot Spots
reducing skew: the application's responsibility
- ex. a very `hot` key: add random number to the key
    - :) writes to the key will be split evenly across partitions
    - :( reads have to read all data from all the keys and combine it
    - :( requires additional bookkeeping

## 3. Partitioning and Secondary Indexes
### 1. Partitioning Secondary Indexes by Document
### 2. Partitioning Secondary Indexes by Term

## 4. Rebalancing Partitions
Moving load from one node in the cluster to another

### 1. Strategies for Rebalancing
### 2. Operations: Automatic or Manual Rebalancing

## 5. Request Routing
### 1. Parallel Query Execution

# Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
from `compute-intensive` to `data-intensive`
- Airflow `trigger` --> now natively supports asyncio

what applications need to do
- database
- cache --> sppeed up reads
- search index
- stream processing
- batch processing
- etc.

## 1. Reliability

continuing to work correctly even when things go wrong
== `fault-tolerant`
!= `failure-tolerant`

---

### fault vs failure
- fault: one `component of the system` deviating from its spec
- failure: `the system as a whole` stops providing the required service to the user

Design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failures
(ex. Netflix Chaos Monkey)

### fault types
1. Hardware Faults
   
    ➡ Add Hardware redundancy (ex. Disk RAID, )
   
2. Software Errors
   
   ex) A runaway process uses up some shared resource 
3. Human Errors


## 2. Scalability
steady `performance` even if `load` increases

---

### Describing Load
load is described by numbers i.e. `load parameters`

`load parameters`: which operations will be common?

#### Twitter Example
handling fan-out 🚨: each user follows many people, and each user is followed by many people

      1. 🐣 → insert into a global collection of tweets
      2. 🐣 → insert the new tweet into each follower's timeline caches

`load parameter`: the distribution of followers per user 

### Describing Performance
What number?
- batch: `throughput`
- online: `response time(= latency + queueing delays + ...)` distribution

What value?
- percentile (median, p99)
  
   ex) tail latencies (high percentiles of resonse time)

That may increase response time...
- queueing delays

How to test?

## 3. Maintainability
1. Operability: visibility to health, etc. 
2. Simplicity: ABSTRACTION
3. Evolvability: Good simplicity(=abstraction) is needed

# Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
from `compute-intensive` to `data-intensive`
- Airflow `trigger` --> now natively supports asyncio

what applications need to do
- store data ➡ database
- remember results to speed up reads ➡ cache
- search data by keyword or filter ➡ search index
- send a message to another process to be handled *asynchronously* ➡ stream processing
- *periodically* curch a large amount of accumulated data ➡ batch processing
- ...

KEY: *Which* tools and *which* approaches are *the most appropriate* for us?

## 1. Reliability

Definition
- continuing to work correctly even when things go wrong
- == `fault-tolerant`
- != `failure-tolerant`

fault vs failure
- fault: one `component of the system` deviating from its spec
- failure: `the system as a whole` stops providing the required service to the user

Design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failures
(ex. Netflix Chaos Monkey)

fault types
1. Hardware Faults
    - Add Hardware redundancy (ex. Disk RAID, )
        - ↑ data volumes & computing ➡ larger number of machines ➡ ↑ hardware fault
    - **\+** software fault-tolerance techniques
        - `rolling upgrade`: patch one node at a time without downtime of the entire system
   
2. Software Errors
    - systematic error within the system
    - harder to anticipate, correlated across nodes ➡ cause many more system failures 
    - ex) A runaway process uses up some shared resource
    - helpful tips
        - process isolation
        - allow process crash and restart
        - monitoring

3. Human Errors

## 2. Scalability

Definition
- steady `performance` even if `load` increases

### 1) Describing Load
load is described by numbers i.e. `load parameters`
- `load parameters`: which operations will be common?
    - ex) requests per second to a server, the ratio of reads to writes in a DB ...
    - average? extreme?
    - an architecture that scales well for a particular application is built base on load parameters

Twitter Example
- main operations: `post tweet` & `home timeline`
- handling `fan-out` 🚨: each user follows many people, and each user is followed by many people
    1. 🐣 tweet 🐣 → insert into a global collection of tweets
    2. 🐣 tweet 🐣 → insert the new tweet into each follower's timeline caches
1. choose (1): struggle to keep up with the load of home timeline queries
2. change to (2): more work at write time and less at read time ➡ 👍:)
    - 🚨 Celebrity 🚨: too many followers ➡ too many work at write
    - `load parameters`: the distribution of followers per user (it determines fan-out load)
4. hybrid
    - Most users' 🐣: fan out to home timelines on writes
    - Celebrities' 🐣: fetched separately and merged with the user's home timeline on reads 

### 2) Describing Performance
What number?
- batch: `throughput`
- online: `response time(= latency + queueing delays + service time ...)` distribution
    - `response time` != `latency`
    - `queuing delays`: ↑ `tail latencies` :(
        - a server can only process a small number of things in parallel
        - `head-of-line blocking`: a server takes a small number of slow requests to hold up the processing of subsequent requests
            - response time ↑ due to prior requests

What value?
- percentile (median, p99)
    - `tail latencies`: high percentiles of response time
        - `tail latency amplification`: when several backend calls are needed to server a request, it takes ***a single slow backend request*** to slow down the entire end-user request 

How to test?
- clients need to keep sending requests ***independently*** of the response time

### 3) Approaches for Coping with Load
approaches
1. `scaling up` = `vertical scaling`: moving to a more powerful machine
2. `scaling out` = `horizontal scaling` = `shared-nothing`: distributing the load across multiple *smaller* machines
   - easy for *stateless* services
3. mix: using several fairly powerful machines

`elastic`: can be automatically scaled out when then detect a load increase
- 👍 for unpredictable loads 
- 👎: more complicated, operational surprises

## 3. Maintainability
1. Operability
    - make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly 
    - visibility to health, etc. 
2. Simplicity: ABSTRACTION
3. Evolvability: Good simplicity(=abstraction) is needed
